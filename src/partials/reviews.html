          I rented the Lagoon 620 with my family for a week-long vacation and it
          was the best decision ever. The yacht was spacious, comfortable, and

          The Azimut 80 was the most luxurious yacht I've ever been on. The cabins
          were spacious and elegant, and the outdoor areas were perfect for
          relaxing and entertaining. Worth every penny!
